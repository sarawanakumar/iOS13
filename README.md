## SceneDelegate vs AppDelegate
Part of Responsibility of AppDelegate is delegated to SceneDelegate. Now our app can have multiple scenes. By Default, our app will have one Scene called as UIWindowScene. The App's Info.plist must keep track of the number of Scenes Being used in a particular app under `Application Scene Manifest`. A window is like a Backdrop derived from Microsoft Windows.
